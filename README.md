This repository contains the R Markdown and report for NHANES dataset analysis (2021â€“2023).

## ðŸ“˜ Overview
This project analyzes adults (â‰¥20 years) from the **2021â€“2023 NHANES** dataset to:
- Examine the relationship between **Body Mass Index (BMI)** and **Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP)**  
- Compare BMI across **education levels** and **race groups**  
- Assess consistency across **three blood pressure trials**

All analyses are done in **R** with reproducible workflows using R Markdown.

## ðŸ§© Main Tasks
| Task | Description |
|------|--------------|
| Q1 | Clean BMI & SBP using IQR and MAD; visualize association by sex |
| Q2 | Analyze BMI distributions by education and race; create boxplots |
| Q3 | Reshape BPX data (wide â†’ long); compare SBP/DBP across 3 trials | 

---

## ðŸ§  Key Findings
- BMI and SBP show a **positive correlation**; males have higher mean SBP.  
- Higher education is associated with **lower BMI**.  
- **Non-Hispanic Black** and **Hispanic** participants have higher BMI medians.  
- BP trials show minimal within-person variation, indicating measurement stability.
